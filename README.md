# burger
The user enters the name of a burger and posts it to the left of the page.  The user can then click the devour button and the burger will be moved over to the eaten burger side on the right.

## Installing / Getting started

This application doesn't require any other installation for a user.

### Initial Configuration

Before starting development of this application, I needed to npm install express and express-handlebars.  I needed to create the database in mysql too.


## Running the tests

The page says enter a country that starts with a C, but you can really enter anything and it will search it for your.
